 Exercise 25 - Password Strength Indicator
 Functions help you abstract away complex operations, but they also help you build reusable components.
 Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:
 - A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
 - A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
 - A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
 - A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.
 Constraints
 - Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument and returns a value you can evaluate
 to determine the password strength. Do not have the function return a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple
 languages in the future.
 - Use a single output statement.
